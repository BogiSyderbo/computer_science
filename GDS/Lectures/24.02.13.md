## Regular expressions

*Regular expressions* are used for specify text patterns.

Match a string or search in a string

"." matches any character
"a" matches a
"ab" matches a followed by b
"$\texttt{[abc]}$"matches one of the character
"$\texttt{[\^abc]}$" matches *not* one of the characters
"$\texttt{[a-z]}$" matches anything between a-z
^ and $ matches beginning and end of line
\A \Z matches beginning and end of entire string

$\texttt{[a-zA-Z0-9]}$ would match everything

```python
import re # Import regular expressions

match()
search()
findall()
group()
groups()
start()
end()
```
