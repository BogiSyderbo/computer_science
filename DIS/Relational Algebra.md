# Basic operations:
- *Selection* $\sigma$ Selects a subset of rows from relation
- *Projection* $\pi$ Deletes unwanted columns from relation
- *Cross-product* $\times$ Allows us to combine two relations
- *Set-difference* - Tuples in relation 1, but not in relation 2
- *Union* $\cup$ Tuples in relation 1 and in relation 2

# Additional operations:
- *Intersection* $\cap$
- *Join* $\bowtie$ (similar to $\land$ in RC)
- *Antijoin* $\triangleright$ (similar to -)
- *Division* $\div$
- *Renaming* $\rho$ : Not essential, but useful.
