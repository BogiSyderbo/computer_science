# Sets
A *set* is a collection of *elements*. For example, the set containing the *elements* $-1$, $0$, and 1 is written as:

$$
\{-1,0,1\}
$$

The set of *natural numbers* is defined as:

$$
\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3, \ldots\}
$$

The *whole numbers* are defined as:

$$
\mathbb{Z}=\{\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \ldots\}
$$

The general notation for sets is written as:

$$
\{\cdots\}
$$

# Intervals
We can represent the *set* of*real numbers* $\mathbb{R}$ with a *number line*:

If we want to visualise a section of the real numbers, we can colour a part of the number line:

In this illustration, the coloured part is the *interval* of our set consisting of all numbers smaller or equal to 2. The following notation can also be used:
$$
\text { ] }-\infty ; 2] .
$$
Here are various *intervals* represented with different notation:

$[a;b]$ is equivalent to $a \leq x \leq b$

$]a;b[$ is equivalent to $a < x < b$

$[a;b[$ is equivalent to $a \leq x < b$
![[Pasted image 20230821135615.png]]
$]a;b]$ is equivalent to $a<x\leq b$
![[Pasted image 20230821135635.png]]

$]a;\infty[$ is equivalent to $a<x$
![[Pasted image 20230821135710.png]]

$[a;\infty[$ is equivalent to $a\leq x$
![[Pasted image 20230821135719.png]]

$]-\infty;b[$ is equivalent to $x< b$
![[Pasted image 20230821135750.png]]

$]-\infty; b]$ is equivalent to  $x\leq b$
