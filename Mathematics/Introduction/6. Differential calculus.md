For a function $f(x)$, $f^{\prime}(x)$ describes the "growth" of $f(x)$ at each point $x$. If we have a tangent to $f(x)$ then the slope of the tangent at the point $\left(x_0, f\left(x_0\right)\right)$ will be $f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)$

This illustrates the relationship between $f^{\prime}\left(x\right)$ and $f(x)$.

A function $f$ is differentiable in $x_0 \in \mathrm{I}_\omega$ if the *difference quotient* (the slope of the secant) has a limit value for $x \rightarrow x_0$.
$$
\frac{f(x)-f\left(x_0\right)}{x-x_0}
$$
We call the limit value the *derivative* in $x_0$, and we denote it $f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)$, i.e.
$$
\frac{f(x)-f\left(x_0\right)}{x-x_0} \rightarrow f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right) \text { for } \quad x \rightarrow x_0
$$

If $f^{\prime}(x)<0$ then $f(x)$ is decreasing at the point $x$.

If $f^{\prime}(x)>0$ then $f(x)$ is increasing at the point $x$.

If $f(x)$ has a maximum, then $f^{\prime}(x)=0$

# The tangent equation
Assume that $f$ is differentiable in $x_0 \in \mathrm{I}_{(\omega)}$.

Then the equation for the tangent $t$ to the graph of $f$ at the point $\mathrm{P}=\left(x_0, f\left(x_0\right)\right)$ is given by
$$
t(x)=f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)+f\left(x_0\right)
$$
## Example
We will investigate if the function $f(x)=x^2$ is differentiable in $x_0=-1$.

So we set $x_0=-1$ and we have to investigate if the difference quotient
$$
\frac{f(x)-f(-1)}{x-(-1)}
$$has a limit value for $x \rightarrow-1$.

We get
$$
\frac{f(x)-f(-1)}{x-(-1)}=\frac{x^2-(-1)^2}{x+1}=\frac{(x+1 )(x-1)}{x+1}=x-1
$$
and when $x \rightarrow-1$, then
$$
\frac{f(x)-f(-1)}{x-(-1)}=x-1 \rightarrow-1-1=-2
$$
So $f$ is differentiable in $x_0=-1$ with differential quotient $f^{\prime}(-1)=-2$.



Since $f(-1)=1$, $f(x)$ has a tangent $t(x)$ in $(-1,1)$ with the prescription
$$
t(x)=f^{\prime}(-1)(x-(-1))+f(-1)=-2(x+1)+1=-2 x-1
$$

# Monotonic behaviour
Assume that $f$ is differentiable:
- if $f^{\prime}(x)$ is positive for all $x$ in an open interval, then $f$ is increasing in the interval
- if $f^{\prime}(x)$ is negative for all $x$ in an open interval, then $f$ is decreasing in the interval
- if $f^{\prime}(x)$ is 0 for all $x$ in an open interval, then $f$ is constant in the interval


The method to determine the monotonic behaviour of a differentiable function $f$:
1. Determine $f^{\prime}(x)$ and solve the equation $f^{\prime}(x)=0$
2. Calculate $f^{\prime}(x)$ in $x$ values ​​around the solutions for $f^{\prime}(x)=0$ and do a sign test for $f^{\prime}(x)$
3. Write down the monotonicity intervals for $f$ based on the sign of $f^{\prime}$

$$
10. Assume that $g(x) \neq 0$ $\forall$ $x \in \mathrm{I}_{\omega}$.
If $f$ and $g$ are both differentiable on the entire $\mathrm{I}_\omega$, then $\frac{f}{g}$ is also differentiable on the entire $\mathrm{I}_\omega$ with differential quotient
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{\prime}(x)=\frac{f^{\prime}(x) g(x)-f(x) g^{\prime} (x)}{(g(x))^2}
$$
