# "Lecture" notes

RISC pipelines have five stages:
- Instruction Fetch (IF)
- Instruction Decode (ID)
- Execute (EX)
- Memory Access (MEM)

# Exercises
Examine how pipelining affects the clock cycle time of the processor. Problems in this exercise assume that individual stages of the datapath have the following latencies:

## 4.16.1
What is the clock cycle time in a pipelined and non-pipelined 
processor?

The clock cycle time will be the sum of the time of each of the components

$$
IF_t+ID_t+EX_t+MEM_t+WB_t=\text{total time}
$$

This gives us:
$$
250\text{ ps}+350\text{ ps}+150\text{ ps}+300\text{ ps}+200\text{ ps}=1250\text{ ps}
$$
