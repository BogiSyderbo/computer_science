# The Internet
![[Pasted image 20240119113130.png]]
*Hosts* are connected via a network of *communication links*.

*Packets* containing data are sent through these links.

A *packet switch* takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. The two most prominent types in todayâ€™s Internet are:
- **Routers**:
- **Link-layer switches**:

*Hosts* access the internet through an*ISP* (*internet service provider*). Each *ISP* is in itself a network of *packet switches* and *communication links*. *ISP*s provide a variety of types of network access to the *hosts*, including residential broadband access such as *cable modem* or *DSL,* high-speed *LAN* access, and mobile wireless access.
