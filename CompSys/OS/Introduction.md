# Introduction
**Operating systems** or **OS** can be seen as *middleware* between applications and hardware.

**Operating systems** provide:
- Standardized interfaces to resources
- Hardware management
- Orchestration of currently executing processes
- Responses to resources access requests
- Handling of access control

The OS takes a physical resource (such as the processor, or memory, or a disk) and transforms it into a more general, powerful, and easy-to-use virtual form of itself. 

Thus, we sometimes refer to the operating system as a *virtual machine*.

The OS is also sometimes known as a *resource manager*. 

The OS uses *virtualisation* ( [[Memory management#Virtualisation]]) to allow:
- many programs to run (sharing the CPU)
- many programs to concurrently access their own instructions and data (sharing memory)
- many programs to access devices (sharing disks)
The CPU, memory, and disks are known as *resources* of the system.
