# Introduction
## Functions

## Hello world!
```
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```

This is a program that contains a function $\texttt{main}$ that receives no arguments.  The function creates an executable file when compiled that prints the string $\texttt{Hello, World!}$ to the console.

By saving the program to a file $\texttt{hello.c}$ and running the command $\texttt{gcc -o hello hello.c}$ to compile the program the executable file $\texttt{hello}$ is created. The file can be run with the command $\texttt{./hello}$.

The first line of the tells the program to include information about the standard input/output library.
