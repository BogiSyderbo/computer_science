# Introduction

The description of an experiment is done via *events* and their *probabilities*.

The *sample space* is the set of all possible *outcomes* of an experiment. 

An *event* is a subset of the *sample space*.

We can represent possible outcomes as *sets* or *probabilities*.

The probability space *finite*, *countably finite*, or *uncountably infinite*.
## Set/probability representation 

*No event* is given with the empty set

*No event* is given with 0 in probability

*All events* is given with the entire set

*All events* is given with 1

## Sets  in probability theory
Elements in a sample space $A$ are called *outcomes*

Properties of set algebra are similar to the [monotone laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) in Boolean algebra.

The *complementary set* is given with:
$$
A^c=U\backslash A
$$
where:
$$
(A \cup B)^c=A^c \cap B^c \text { and }(A \cap B)^c=A^c \cup B^c
$$

## Sample space (Pebble World) example
![[Pasted image 20231120104017.png]]
$A\cup B$ consists of the 8 pebbles in $A$ or $B$
$A\cap B$ consists of the single pebble in $A$ and $B$
$A^c$ consists of the 4 pebbles not in $A$.

## Example coin toss
1. Let $A_1$ be the event that the first flip is Heads. As a set,
$$
A_1=\left\{\left(1, s_2, \ldots, s_{10}\right): s_j \in\{0,1\} \text { for } 2 \leq j \leq 10\right\} .
$$

This is a subset of the sample space, so it is indeed an event; saying that $A_1$ occurs is the same thing as saying that the first flip is Heads. 

Similarly, let $A_j$ be the event that the $j$ th flip is Heads for $j=2,3, \ldots, 10$.

2. Let $B$ be the event that at least one flip was Heads. As a set,
$$
B=\bigcup_{j=1}^{10} A_j .
$$

3. Let $C$ be the event that all the flips were Heads. As a set,
$$
C=\bigcap_{j=1}^{10} A_j .
$$
4. Let $D$ be the event that there were at least two consecutive Heads. As a set,
$$
D=\bigcup_{j=1}^9\left(A_j \cap A_{j+1}\right)
$$
