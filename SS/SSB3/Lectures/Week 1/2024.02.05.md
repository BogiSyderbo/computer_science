The description of an experiment is done via *events* and their *probabilities*.

The *sample space* is the set of all possible *outcomes* of an experiment. 

An *event* is a subset of the *sample space*.

We can represent possible outcomes as *sets* or *probabilities*.

The probability space *finite*, *countably finite*, or *uncountably infinite*.

Properties of set algebra are similar to the [monotone laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) in Boolean algebra.

**De Morgan's Law**:
$$
(A \cup B)^c=A^c \cap B^c
$$
$$
(A \cap B)^c=A^c \cup B^c
$$
## Naive definition of probability
**Definition 1.3.1** **(Naive definition of probability)**. Let $A$ be an event for an experiment with a finite sample space $S$. The naive probability of $A$ is
$$
P_{\text {naive }}(A)=\frac{|A|}{|S|}=\frac{\text { number of outcomes favorable to } A}{\text { total number of outcomes in } S}
$$
## Combinatorics

**Theorem 1.4.1 (Multiplication rule)**. Consider a compound experiment consisting of two sub-experiments, Experiment $A$ and Experiment $B$. Suppose that Experiment $A$ has $a$ possible outcomes, and for each of those outcomes Experiment $B$ has $b$ possible outcomes. Then the compound experiment has $a b$ possible outcomes.

### Tree diagram ("counting trees")

![[Pasted image 20231120111911.png]]
To see why the multiplication rule is true, imagine a tree diagram as in the figure. Let the tree branch $a$ ways according to the possibilities for Experiment $A$, and for each of those branches create $b$ further branches for Experiment B. Overall, there are $\underbrace{b+b+\cdots+b}_a=a b$ possibilities.

## Sampling
**Theorem 1.4.7 (Sampling with replacement).** Consider $n$ objects and making $k$ choices from them, one at a time with replacement (i.e., choosing a certain object does not preclude it from being chosen again). Then there are $n^k$ possible outcomes

**Theorem 1.4.8 (Sampling without replacement).** Consider $n$ objects and making $k$ choices from them, one at a time without replacement (i.e., choosing a certain object precludes it from being chosen again).

Then there are $n(n-1) \cdots(n-k+1)$ possible outcomes for $1 \leq k \leq n$, and 0 possibilities for $k>n$ (where order matters). By convention, $n(n-1) \cdots(n-k+1)=n$ for $k=1$.
## Permutations
A *permutation* of $1,2, \ldots, n$ is an arrangement of them in some order, e.g., $3,5,1,2,4$ is a permutation of $1,2,3,4,5$. 

By **Theorem 1.4.8** with $k=n$, there are $n!$ permutations of $1,2, \ldots, n$.

## Binomial coefficient
**Definition 1.4.14 (Binomial coefficient).** For any nonnegative integers $k$ and $n$, the binomial coefficient $\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ k\end{array}\right)$, read as " $n$ choose $k$ ", is the number of subsets of size $k$ for a set of size $n$.


For example, $\left(\begin{array}{l}4 \\ 2\end{array}\right)=6$,. The binomial coefficient $\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ k\end{array}\right)$ is sometimes called a combination, but we do not use that terminology here since "combination" is such a useful general-purpose word.

Algebraically, binomial coefficients can be computed as follows:

**Theorem 1.4.15 (Binomial coefficient formula).** For $k \leq n$, we have
$$
\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
k
\end{array}\right)=\frac{n(n-1) \cdots(n-k+1)}{k !}=\frac{n !}{(n-k) ! k !} .

## General definition of probability
**Definition 1.6.1**: A *probability space* consists of a sample space $S$ and a *probability* function $P$ which takes an event $A\subseteq S$ as input and returns $P(A)$, a real number between 0 and 1, as output. The function $P$ must satisfy the following axioms:
1. $\:P(\emptyset)=0,\:P(S)=1.$ 
 2. If $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ are disjoint events, then
$$
P\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty}A_{j}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}P(A_{j}).
$$

(Saying that these *events* are *disjoint* means that they are *mutually exclusive* $\colon A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset$ for $i\neq j.)$
### Properties of probability
**Theorem 1.6.2 (Properties of probability)**: Probability has the following properties, for any events $A$ and $B.$
 1. $:P(A^{c})=1-P(A)$ 
 2. If $A\subseteq B$ then $P( A) \leq P( B)$
 3. $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$
### Inclusion-exclusion principle
$$
|A\cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|
$$
## Example coin toss
1. Let $A_1$ be the event that the first flip is Heads. As a set,
$$
A_1=\left\{\left(1, s_2, \ldots, s_{10}\right): s_j \in\{0,1\} \text { for } 2 \leq j \leq 10\right\} .
$$

This is a subset of the sample space, so it is indeed an event; saying that $A_1$ occurs is the same thing as saying that the first flip is Heads. 

Similarly, let $A_j$ be the event that the $j$ th flip is Heads for $j=2,3, \ldots, 10$.

2. Let $B$ be the event that at least one flip was Heads. As a set,
$$
B=\bigcup_{j=1}^{10} A_j .
$$

3. Let $C$ be the event that all the flips were Heads. As a set,
$$
C=\bigcap_{j=1}^{10} A_j .
$$
4. Let $D$ be the event that there were at least two consecutive Heads. As a set,

Intuitively, we can see $\cap$ as a logical *AND* operator, and $\cup$  as a logical *OR* operator.

## Example 
Combinations of the word *STATISTICS*

Out of a total 10 letters, we can  arrange 3 Ss, 3  Ts, 2 Is, 1 A, and 1 C.

We need to take out the Ss, Ts, and Is from the total permutations since their order doesn't matter. 
$$
\left(\begin{array}{l}10  \\ 3\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{l}7  \\ 3\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{l}4  \\ 2\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{l}2  \\ 1\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{l}1  \\ 1\end{array}\right)
=\frac{10!}{3!3!2!}
$$

## Exercises 1.9

### 2

#### a

 **Q**: How many 7-digit phone numbers are possible, assuming that the first digit can’t be a 0 or a 1?

**A**: For a 7-digit phone number with 10 possible digits, we would have $10^7$ possible numbers according to the *multiplication principle*. However, since the first digits can't be 0 or 1, we only have 8 possible digits for our first number. This leaves us with the answer $(10-2)^1\cdot10^6=8\cdot10^6$.

#### b

**Q**:  Resolve a but the phone number is not allowed to start with 911 either.

**A**: We subtract the the numbers that start with 911 from the previous answer $(8\cdot10^6)-10^{7-3}$.  

### 3
Fred is planning to go out to dinner each night of a certain week, Monday through Friday, with each dinner being at one of his ten favourite restaurants.

#### a
**Q**: How many possibilities are there for Fred’s schedule of dinners for that Monday through Friday, if Fred is not willing to eat at the same restaurant more than once?

**A**: Fred has five nights: M, Tu, W, Th, F and 10 restaurants. This gives us the answer: $10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6=\frac{10!}{5!}$ by the *naive definition of probability*.


### 23
**Q**: Three people get into an empty elevator at the first floor of a building that has 10 floors. Each presses the button for their desired floor (unless one of the others has already pressed that button). Assume that they are equally likely to want to go to floors 2 through 10 (independently of each other). What is the probability that the buttons for 3 consecutive floors are pressed?

**A**: We have 9 floors to choose from for three people. The consecutive sequences are:

2 3 4
3 4 5
4 5 6
6 7 8
7 8 9
8 9 10

Each of the 6 sequences has $3!=6$ combinations. For example 2,3,4:
2 3 4
2 4 3
3 2 4
3 4 2
4 2 3
4 3 2

Since three people have nine choices, the *sample space* is: $9^3$.

Since we have 6 sequences we have $6^6$ desirable outcomes.

Using the *naive definition of probability*:
![[SS/SSB3/Lectures/Week 1/2024.02.05#Naive definition of probability]]
We get the answer:
$$
\frac{6^6}{9^3}
$$
### 29

#### a

**Q**:  Is the probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 21 greater, less, or equal to the probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 22.

**A**:
1. Probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 21

2. Probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 22

The sample space is $6^4$ in both cases, since we have 4 dice with 6 sides.

How we have to workout the number of favourable outcomes in both cases.

For *1*:

6 6 6 3 = 21
6 6 5 4 = 21
6 5 5 5 = 21

So we have three sequences in random order. We can work out the number of ways to order each sequence

6 6 6 3 = $\frac{4!}{3!}=4$
6 6 5 4 = $\frac{4!}{2!}=12$
6 5 5 5 = $\frac{4!}{3!}=4$

So there are $4+4+12=20$ possibilites.

For *2*:
6 6 6 4
6 6 5 5

Number of ways to order each sequence:

6 6 6 4 = $\frac{4!}{3!}=4$
6 6 5 5 = $\frac{4!}{2!}=12$

Such that there are $4+12=16$ possibilites. (Wrong, actual answer 22)

We can then work out the probabilities:
1. $\frac{20}{6^4}=0.154$
2. $\frac{22}{6^4}=0.170$
### 32
**Q**: Four cards are face down on a table. You are told that two are red and two are black, and you need to guess which two are red and which two are black. You do this by pointing to the two cards you’re guessing are red (and then implicitly you’re guessing that the other two are black). Assume that all configurations are equally likely. Find the probability that exactly $j$ of your guesses are correct, for $j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

**A**: Amount of possible configurations: $\frac{4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1}{2\cdot2}=6$

We divide the amount of possible configurations for each by the total number of possible configurations

0 guesses = $\frac{1}{6}$
2 guesses = $\frac{4}{6}$
4 guesses = $\frac{1}{6}$
