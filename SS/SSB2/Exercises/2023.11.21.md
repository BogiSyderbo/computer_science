## a
10 possible numbers for each digit except the first one. So we have 6 digits with 10 possible numbers and one with 8 possible numbers.
$(10-2)^1\times 10^6=8\times10^6$
## b
Now the phone numbers are not allowed to start with 911. 
$8\times10^6-10^4$

Three people get into an empty elevator at the first floor of a building that has 10 floors. Each presses the button for their desired floor (unless one of the others has already pressed that button). Assume that they are equally likely to want to go to floors 2 through 10 (independently of each other). What is the probability that the buttons for 3 consecutive floors are pressed?

We have 9 floors to choose from for three people. The consecutive sequences are:

2 3 4
3 4 5
4 5 6
6 7 8
7 8 9
8 9 10

Each of the 6 sequences has $3!=6$ combinations :
2 3 4
2 4 3
3 2 4
3 4 2
4 2 3
4 3 2

Since three people have nine choices, the *sample space* is: $9^3$.

Since we have 6 sequences we have $6^6$ desirable outcomes.

Using the *naive definition of probability*:
![[SS/SSB2/Lectures/2023.11.20#Naive definition of probability]]

The answer is:
$$
\frac{6^6}{9^3}
$$

## a
1. Probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 21

2. Probability that the total after rolling 4 fair dice is 22

The sample space is $6^4$, since we have 4 dice with 6 sides.

How we have to workout the number of favourable outcomes in both cases.

For *1*:

6 6 6 3
6 6 5 4
6 5 5 5 

So we have three sequences in random order. We can work out the number of ways to order each sequence

6 6 6 3 = $\frac{4!}{3!}=4$
6 6 5 4 = $\frac{4!}{2!}=12$
6 5 5 5 = $\frac{4!}{3!}=4$

So there are $4+4+12=20$ possibilites.

For *2*:
6 6 6 4
6 6 5 5

Number of ways to order each sequence:

6 6 6 4 = $\frac{4!}{3!}=4$
6 6 5 5 = $\frac{4!}{2!}=12$

The probability is the .

Four cards are face down on a table. You are told that two are red and two are black, and you need to guess which two are red and which two are black. You do this by pointing to the two cards you’re guessing are red (and then implicitly you’re guessing that the other two are black). Assume that all configurations are equally likely, and that you do not have psychic powers. Find the probability that exactly $j$ of your guesses are correct, for $j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.
