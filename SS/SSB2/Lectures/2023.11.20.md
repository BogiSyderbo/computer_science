# Introduction

The description of an experiment is done via *events* and their *probabilities*.

The *sample space* is the set of all possible *outcomes* of an experiment. 

An *event* is a subset of the *sample space*.

We can represent possible outcomes as *sets* or *probabilities*.

The probability space *finite*, *countably finite*, or *uncountably infinite*.
## Set/probability representation 

*No event* is given with the empty set

*No event* is given with 0 in probability

*All events* is given with the entire set

*All events* is given with 1

## Sets  in probability theory
Elements in a sample space $A$ are called *outcomes*

Properties of set algebra are similar to the [monotone laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) in Boolean algebra.

The *complementary set* is given with:
$$
A^c=U\backslash A
$$
where:
$$
(A \cup B)^c=A^c \cap B^c \text { and }(A \cap B)^c=A^c \cup B^c
$$

## Sample space (Pebble World) example
![[Pasted image 20231120104017.png]]
$A\cup B$ consists of the 8 pebbles in $A$ or $B$
$A\cap B$ consists of the single pebble in $A$ and $B$
$A^c$ consists of the 4 pebbles not in $A$.

## Example coin toss
1. Let $A_1$ be the event that the first flip is Heads. As a set,
$$
A_1=\left\{\left(1, s_2, \ldots, s_{10}\right): s_j \in\{0,1\} \text { for } 2 \leq j \leq 10\right\} .
$$

This is a subset of the sample space, so it is indeed an event; saying that $A_1$ occurs is the same thing as saying that the first flip is Heads. 

Similarly, let $A_j$ be the event that the $j$ th flip is Heads for $j=2,3, \ldots, 10$.

2. Let $B$ be the event that at least one flip was Heads. As a set,
$$
B=\bigcup_{j=1}^{10} A_j .
$$

3. Let $C$ be the event that all the flips were Heads. As a set,
$$
C=\bigcap_{j=1}^{10} A_j .
$$
4. Let $D$ be the event that there were at least two consecutive Heads. As a set,
$$
D=\bigcup_{j=1}^9\left(A_j \cap A_{j+1}\right)
$$
## Naive definition of probability
**Definition 1.3.1** **(Naive definition of probability)**. Let $A$ be an event for an experiment with a finite sample space $S$. The naive probability of $A$ is
$$
P_{\text {naive }}(A)=\frac{|A|}{|S|}=\frac{\text { number of outcomes favorable to } A}{\text { total number of outcomes in } S}
$$

# Combinatorics
**The art of counting**

**Theorem 1.4.1 (Multiplication rule)**. Consider a compound experiment consisting of two sub-experiments, Experiment $A$ and Experiment $B$. Suppose that Experiment $A$ has $a$ possible outcomes, and for each of those outcomes Experiment $B$ has $b$ possible outcomes. Then the compound experiment has $a b$ possible outcomes.

To see why the multiplication rule is true, imagine a tree diagram as in the figure. Let the tree branch $a$ ways according to the possibilities for Experiment $A$, and for each of those branches create $b$ further branches for Experiment B. Overall, there are $\underbrace{b+b+\cdots+b}_a=a b$ possibilities.

## Example (Ice cream cones)
Chocolate (C), Vanilla (V), Strawberry (S)

There are $2\cdot3=6$ or $3\cdot2=6$ possibilities.

## Sampling
**Theorem 1.4.7 (Sampling with replacement).** Consider $n$ objects and making $k$ choices from them, one at a time with replacement (i.e., choosing a certain object does not preclude it from being chosen again). Then there are $n^k$ possible outcomes

**Theorem 1.4.8 (Sampling without replacement).** Consider $n$ objects and making $k$ choices from them, one at a time without replacement (i.e., choosing a certain object precludes it from being chosen again).

Then there are $n(n-1) \cdots(n-k+1)$ possible outcomes for $1 \leq k \leq n$, and 0 possibilities for $k>n$ (where order matters). By convention, $n(n-1) \cdots(n-k+1)=n$ for $k=1$.

## Permutations
A *permutation* of $1,2, \ldots, n$ is an arrangement of them in some order, e.g., $3,5,1,2,4$ is a permutation of $1,2,3,4,5$. By **Theorem 1.4.8** with $k=n$, there are $n$ ! permutations of $1,2, \ldots, n$. For example, there are $n$ ! ways in which $n$ people can line up for ice cream. (Recall that $n$ ! is $n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots 1$ for any positive integer $n$, and $0 !=1$.)
## Binomial coefficient
**Definition 1.4.14 (Binomial coefficient).** For any nonnegative integers $k$ and $n$, the binomial coefficient $\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ k\end{array}\right)$, read as " $n$ choose $k$ ", is the number of subsets of size $k$ for a set of size $n$.

For example, $\left(\begin{array}{l}4 \\ 2\end{array}\right)=6$,. The binomial coefficient $\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ k\end{array}\right)$ is sometimes called a combination, but we do not use that terminology here since "combination" is such a useful general-purpose word. Algebraically, binomial coefficients can be computed as follows.

**Theorem 1.4.15 (Binomial coefficient formula).** For $k \leq n$, we have
$$
\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
k
\end{array}\right)=\frac{n(n-1) \cdots(n-k+1)}{k !}=\frac{n !}{(n-k) ! k !} .
$$
