## Separable differential equations

A differential equation is *separable* if it can be written in the form:
$$
q(y)y^{\prime}=p(x)
$$

## Second order differential equations
Generally, a *second-order, linear differential equation* is in the form:
$$
y^{\prime\prime}+p(x)y^{\prime}+q(x)y=h(x)
$$

where $p$, $q$, and $h$ are known functions.

### Homogeneous second order differential equations
A second order linear differential equation is called *homogeneous* if $h(x)$ is 0, and thus has the general form:
$$
y^{\prime\prime}+py^{\prime}+qy=0
$$
A solution to this kind of equation where it has constant coefficients is:
$$
y^{\prime\prime}(x)+py^{\prime}(x)+qy(x)=0, \quad \forall x\in\mathbb{R}
$$
**Lemma**:
If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are two solutions to a *homogeneous second order linear differential equation*, then 
$$
y(x)=C_{y_1}(x)+D_{y_2}(x)
$$
is a solution for all choices of constants $C, D \in \mathbb{R}$.


# Lecture notes
Let $y$ be a solution.

$$
u(x)=y(x)e^{-r_1x} \Leftrightarrow y(x)=u(x)e^{r_1x} 
$$

$$
y^{\prime\prime}+y^{\prime}+qy=e^{r_1x}(u^{\prime\prime}+(r_1-r_2)u^{\prime})
$$
# Exercise notes
There are two types of differential equations: *seperable* and *first order*. There are two separate ways to solve each kind.
