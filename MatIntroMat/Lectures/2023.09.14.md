## Domain
The *domain* $\mathrm{D} m(f)$ of a function $f$ is the *set* of inputs accepted by the function. The corresponding outputs is called the *codomain* $Vm(f)$ .

If a set $A$ is the *domain* of a function $f$ we can write it as:
$$
f:A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$
Where the *codomain* is:
$$
Vm(f)=\{f(x)\mid x\in Dm(f)\}
$$
## Continuous functions
We say that a function is *continuous* for a point $a\in Dm(f)$ if:
$$
\forall \epsilon>0~\exists\delta>0,~x\in Dm(f)~\land~|x-a|<\delta : |f(x)-f(a)|<\epsilon 
$$
