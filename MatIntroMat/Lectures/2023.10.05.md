## Taylor polynomial
Suppose that $f$ is $n$ times differentiable on the point $a$. Then the polynomial:
$$
\begin{aligned}
h(x)= & f(a)+f^{\prime}(a)(x-a)+\frac{f^{\prime \prime}(a)}{2}(x-a)^2+\frac{f^{\prime \prime \prime}(a)}{6}(x-a)^3+\cdots \\
& \quad+\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k !}(x-a)^k+\cdots+\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}(x-a)^n \\
= & \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k !}(x-a)^k
\end{aligned}
$$
the only $n$-th degree polynomial that has function values and the same $n$ first derivatives $f$ on point $a$.

The polynomial above is called the *Taylor-polynomial* for $f$ of degree $n$ around the point $a$. We denote it as $T_n f$ such that:
$$
T_n f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k !}(x-a)^k .
