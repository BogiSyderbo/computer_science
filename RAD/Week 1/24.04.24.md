## Min-cut continuation
Here we can see a step in the [min-cut algorithm](24.04.22#Min-cut Algorithm):

Here we can see that edge $e=(1,2)$ is *contracted*,  where we merge two end- points of an edge into a single vertex. With each *contraction* the number of vertices of $G$ is decreased by one.

## Monte Carlo

Some probability of error, running time may be random.

### One-sided Monte Carlo
Non-zero probability of failure when it outputs *true* or *false*.

The one answer your receive may be wrong.

### Two-sided Monte Carlo
Probability of failure is 0 for at least one of two possible outputs (*true*/*false*)

### Las Vegas
Always returns correct answer. Running time is a stochastic variable

## Binary Planar Partition
