## Dynamic programming
To develop a dynamic-programming algorithm, follow the sequence:
1. Characterise the structure of an optimal solution
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information
