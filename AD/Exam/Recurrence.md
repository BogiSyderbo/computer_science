# Recurrence
[CLRS 4.1] 

A *recurrence* is an equation that describes a function in terms of its value on other arguments.

The general form of a recurrence is an equation or inequality that describes a function over the integers or reals using the function itself.

The recurrence contains two or more cases depending on the argument. *Recursive cases* involve the recursive invocation of the functions on smaller inputs. If a case doesn't involve a recursive invocation, it's the *base case*.

The recurrence is *well-defined* if there is at least one function that satisfies it, and *ill-defined* otherwise.
